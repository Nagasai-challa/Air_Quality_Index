# Real-Time Air Quality Prediction

## Overview
This project is focused on developing a machine learning model to predict the air quality index (AQI) in real-time for Indian cities. The model provides accurate AQI predictions and suggests precautionary measures based on the air quality levels.

## Features
- Predicts real-time **Air Quality Index (AQI)** for Indian cities.
- Provides **precautionary measures** based on AQI levels (e.g., mask-wearing, indoor activities).
- Trained using the **XGBoost** algorithm, achieving an accuracy of **93%**.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Languages**: Python
- **Machine Learning**: XGBoost
- **Platforms**: Kaggle
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project was sourced from **Kaggle**, containing historical air quality data from various Indian monitoring stations. It includes parameters like PM2.5, PM10, temperature, and humidity.

## Model Training
- The model is trained using the **XGBoost** algorithm, focusing on features such as PM2.5, PM10, and other environmental variables.
- The model achieves **93% accuracy**, providing reliable predictions of air quality levels.

## Installation
